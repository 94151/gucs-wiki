# Beginner's guide to mobile web development

## Instructions

1. The objective of this activity is to learn the basics of Mobile Web Development through undertaking tasks and completing them within the given time.

2. This would provide useful learning experiences through collaboration and team work.

3. Every week, a list of tasks would be posted and everyone is *suggested* to take up a task.

4. Post the task number on the task list thread. Repetition is allowed only if the task list is exhausted. If the replies are very high, wait for me to post a new set of tasks.

5. Wait for me to acknowledge your reply on the task list thread before you start to design the tutorial.

6. A tutorial can be made in two ways-
a) Writing a *Article on Medium*.
b) Making a *Youtube Video*.

7. Guidelines for making and posting the tutorial on the channel-
a) Your article/video should be in *Clear English Sentences* and try to make it interesting.
b) Your post for the tutorial should contain three things in the same order- *Activity Name*, *Task List Set Number*, *Task Number* and the *Link for the Article or Video* that you have made.
c) Remember to keep the *article reading time/ video length not more than 15 minutes*.
d) Failure in following the guidelines will result in the reiteration of the task undertaken.

8. The deadline for completing the tasks is exactly a week from the day the task list was posted unless otherwise stated.

9. We now have a separate *Youtube Brand Channel* and *Medium Publication* named *“Beginner’s Guide to Mobile Web Development”*.

10. All communication regarding to the above channels should be made on the Mail ID- *“beginner.mwis18@gmail.com”*.

11. For uploading video tutorials on the Youtube Brand Channel, you can forward your request on the above Mail ID from your own Mail ID, mentioning your slack handle for identification. I will then grant you access to the channel as the Brand Manager. This will allow you to upload videos on the channel.

12. Now same for the Medium Publication, you can forward your request on the above Mail ID from your own Mail ID, mentioning your slack handle for identification. I will then grant you access to the channel as the Writer. This will allow you to submit articles.

13. Please Note- *Since we have separate channels for articles and videos, do not post any tutorial or it’s link, here in the slack channel.*

14. I strongly recommend everyone to provide feedback to the Writers/ Managers at Medium/Youtube so that the quality of the tutorials can be maintained.
