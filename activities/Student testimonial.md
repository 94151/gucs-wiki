## What is a Relevant testimonial?

A Relevant testimonial, is that one piece of note, that showcases Why and How Udacity in general, and The mobile web challenge In Particular, has helped you achieve a new level of
1. Efficiency as a coder
2. Perspective as a person
3. Excitement in a day to day routine.

## Why are we doing this here?

1.Because we are a huge community, and Not everybody always gets a say!!! Have a say : Udacity would like to gather your thoughts on how Udacity and this challenge helped you.
2. Because an offline meetup, is recommended , but not always feasible, and most of you join here by default, This alert, is to raise awareness about a testimonial initiative.
An initiative, to loop in the likes of google , to recognize the Successes of the community, in general, and Extraordinary Individual Successes brought about by the community
