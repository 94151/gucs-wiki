# Write or Recite your “Story”. 

In this activity, you are required to either write your story the usual old way or to make a video of yourself reciting your story to the world. (You can choose either one!)

## So what’s a story?
A story is something that includes 3 things: **Knowledge, Experience and Inspiration**. If you are here to up-skill / re-skill yourself, then we would like to hear it. If you are a working mother / father trying to make a name for herself / himself, then we would like to hear it. If you are someone who are fighting against all the odds to complete this scholarship, then we would like to hear it and there many other ways you can write your story. Just do keep in mind the 3 things that I mentioned above.

At the end of story, you can also tell us about your experience in the scholarship program so far.

## What’s in it for you?
Some of the best stories will be featured to Google in my next update to them and who knows maybe your story will get published publicly to inspire the whole world.
