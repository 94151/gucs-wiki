# Collaborative Projects

## List of Projects

### 1. [Scholarship Projects Showcase App](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app)
**Description**: The idea is to build a web app that will be the home page for all the applications which will be built under the scholarship program.

We will be using Git for version control but how will we be getting to know all the projects which others will build. For this we can have a web app that can be common trigger point for all the projects. 
Not only this it can also be used to show descriptions about the projects, and can be used to get contributions from others. 

It will be similar to Kickstarter in some way but it won't be used to post project ideas rather project descriptions, issues and query logs.

Apart from all this we can also build a chatbot to get integrated with this app which can provide information about all the apps that are present.

This application can also be used to track progress of each application.

When next batch of Udacity starts, this application link can be shared to give others an idea what the previous batch built. This application will showcase efforts of each and every individual collectively and not as separate teams.

### 4. [Blood Donation App](#)
**Description**: A platform where people can donate their blood directly to the patient rather than donating to the blood bank. The platform will help in decreasing storage costs of blood , maintain a database of peculiar donors with rare conditions. And require an authentication from registered doctors to  authorize a donation alert. It will send alert according to certain priorities as proximity to area, their relation with the patient etc. We may even reward the donors with some certificates and significant discount coupons.
The app can even be expanded to include signup for organ donation and immediate report if someone dead's organs are required to save someone's life immediately.
The main purpose is to cut the process where people just waste the critical time to save someone's life. And expansion can easily be  made either in medical area or social area.

Blood Donation application, that will connect blood banks, blood donors and blood requesters on a single platform
(I have been developing this using Ionic 2 as of now on a private repository.)

Building a web app for connecting blood donors to blood-needy people seamlessly.

### 5. [Guess the Quote](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/guess-quote)
**Description**: An PWA quiz game called Guess the Quote, that asks the user to guess who said the following quote or which book it belongs to. The main idea is to include music and animations and cache them for rich offline experience.

## FAQs

**So what are collaborative projects?**

In this program, you have to work with your peers on the slack workspace and create a technology solution that will help the community or maybe the whole world. A technology solution can be anything - maybe a android application or a website(mobile/desktop).

**What will you gain out of this?**

Contributing in this will not only increase your subject matter knowledge but will also give you an experience of working in a team collaborative environment that most of the companies out there are looking for.

**How are we going to do this?**

We will be collaborating using one of the best version control platforms i.e. Github. I know most of you won’t know about Github yet and it may be tough to get into this. But GitHub is something that you should be using on a daily basis. It is like bread and butter for any developer out there. If you want to get started, just enroll in this Udacity’s free course: https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775.
