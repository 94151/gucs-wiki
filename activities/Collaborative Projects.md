# Collaborative Projects

## List of Projects

### 1. [Scholarship Projects Showcase App](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/showcase-app)
**Description**: The idea is to build a web app that will be the home page for all the applications which will be built under the scholarship program.

We will be using Git for version control but how will we be getting to know all the projects which others will build. For this we can have a web app that can be common trigger point for all the projects. 
Not only this it can also be used to show descriptions about the projects, and can be used to get contributions from others. 

It will be similar to Kickstarter in some way but it won't be used to post project ideas rather project descriptions, issues and query logs.

Apart from all this we can also build a chatbot to get integrated with this app which can provide information about all the apps that are present.

This application can also be used to track progress of each application.

When next batch of Udacity starts, this application link can be shared to give others an idea what the previous batch built. This application will showcase efforts of each and every individual collectively and not as separate teams.


### 2. [Notes App](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/just-notes)
**Description**: Simple Note Progressive Web App with support of markdown. Simple app with some feature and saved notes in browser storage.

 Features -
+ Simple autocomplete
+ Text to speech (using browser speech synthesis)
+ Dark and light theme
+ Copy and download(in .md) the note text on a button click
+ Light weight (only essential use of plugins)

Tech use -
+ React js
+ Marked.js for markdown
+ Bootstrap (some components)


### 3. [Udacity Pathfinder PWA](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/udabot)
**Description**: ChatBot for Udacity Programs: (Progressive Web Bot) 

Idea:
1. The bot will suggest the  track of the  udacity nanodegree program based on the users different inputs and their interest from the sentimental analysis

2. The bot will also act as mentor for the students as well

3. It can also be done as a Progressive web Bot

Technology Stack:
1. React with any Bot Framework including service worker

### 4. [Blood Donation App](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/blood-donation)
**Description**: A platform where people can donate their blood directly to the patient rather than donating to the blood bank. The platform will help in decreasing storage costs of blood , maintain a database of peculiar donors with rare conditions. And require an authentication from registered doctors to  authorize a donation alert. It will send alert according to certain priorities as proximity to area, their relation with the patient etc. We may even reward the donors with some certificates and significant discount coupons.
The app can even be expanded to include signup for organ donation and immediate report if someone dead's organs are required to save someone's life immediately.
The main purpose is to cut the process where people just waste the critical time to save someone's life. And expansion can easily be  made either in medical area or social area.

Blood Donation application, that will connect blood banks, blood donors and blood requesters on a single platform
(I have been developing this using Ionic 2 as of now on a private repository.)

Building a web app for connecting blood donors to blood-needy people seamlessly.
(Basic version of the app at: https://bloodbank-iiit.herokuapp.com)

### 5. [Guess the Quote](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/guess-quote)
**Description**: An PWA quiz game called Guess the Quote, that asks the user to guess who said the following quote or which book it belongs to. The main idea is to include music and animations and cache them for rich offline experience.

## FAQs

**So what are collaborative projects?**

In this program, you have to work with your peers on the slack workspace and create a technology solution that will help the community or maybe the whole world. A technology solution can be anything - maybe a android application or a website(mobile/desktop).

**What will you gain out of this?**

Contributing in this will not only increase your subject matter knowledge but will also give you an experience of working in a team collaborative environment that most of the companies out there are looking for.

**How are we going to do this?**

We will be collaborating using one of the best version control platforms i.e. Github. I know most of you won’t know about Github yet and it may be tough to get into this. But GitHub is something that you should be using on a daily basis. It is like bread and butter for any developer out there. If you want to get started, just enroll in this Udacity’s free course: https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775.

**What this means for the moderators/Co-Moderators?**

I have created this new channel: #collab_prjcts where all the communication related to Collaborative Projects will take place. After we have made the GitHub repository for the projects, it will be the job of the moderators to pitch their idea and their plan here so that they can persuade other students to join them.

**What this means for the students?**

Students can select a project on which they would like to work (even multiple projects can be selected). To contribute to the project, you will have to create a *Pull Request* to the project which will be then approved by the moderators/Co-Moderators. See the steps here on how you can do this:
https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312.
I know most of you won’t know much about Git/GitHub yet, so please feel free to post your queries at #git_github channel. You can also see our Git/Github free course to learn better:
https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775.

**Timeline of these Projects**

Collaborative projects are supposed to be something that can go beyond the scope of this program and those students who don’t get selected for phase 2 of the program can still work on them. But yes you should make a workable app by the end of phase 1 so that we can showcase your work to the Google Team. This is really important that you do make something which we can send to Google in order to gain some attention.

**How many projects can you contribute to?**

You can contribute to as many projects as you want. But do remember that your progress here will be seen on the basis of your quality contribution and not the number of times you contribute.
