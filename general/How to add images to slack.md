# How to add Images to the Slack Channel
Uploading images directly is a no-no! Here are the steps to upload images properly to the slack channels
## on Web
1. Click your name on **Direct Messages** section of sidebar.
2. Upload image.
3. Open the uploaded image, **Create external link** from the menu.
4. Copy and paste external link to appropriate thread.
## on Mobile
Unfortunately, there is no native way to do it in mobile devices. Make use of some **3rd party image sharing software such as Gyazo** (download for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gyazo-camera/id625725292?mt=8) , [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notainc.gyazo&hl=en_GB))
